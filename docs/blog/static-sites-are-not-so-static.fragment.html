          <h3>Static Sites Are Not So Static</h3>
          <p>Static websites refer to websites where the html of the page was rendered before your request was ever sent to the server. This is without exceptions the best performance possible. Delivering flat html files which can be distributed over a content delivery network. This requires robust build time capabilities for turning various streams of code and content into the end result web page that the user sees. However it is not as limiting as someone who comes from a strong server side generation background might think.</p>
<p>To start, a static site can be a single page application as long as the body content of each page is available from the server along with the full html page. If this is the case then client side JS can be used to load in only the body content of new pages after the initial page load.</p>
<p>Static sites can also be progressive web apps and can be available offline. Nothing about PWA's prevents a static site from utilizing these features. In fact limiting tight server side coupling makes these features easier.</p>
<p>Lastly, dynamic, API driven interactive features with user specific content are also easily available with static site generation and even work best when decoupled from the server. Static content, HTML, CSS, and JS can be loaded with the speed advantages of static site generation. Then, the dynamic features of the application can load after the page load by JS.</p>
