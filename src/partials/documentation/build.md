## Production Build

The production ready build of your website can be performed as follows:

```bash
npx orison build
npx orison static
```

Then preview the production build at localhost:3000. Then you can simply deliver the /docs directory to your hosting service. The template projects will have details instructions on how to do this for Github Pages, Firebase, and Netlify.
